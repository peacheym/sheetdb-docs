## Example spreadsheet

To make it convenient for you to explore this documentation, you can use our test API. As mentioned earlier in the first row there should be column names, for this API they are `id`, `name`, `age` and `comment`.

<Note>
    You can modify the test API - it resets every fifteen minutes.
</Note>

Here is a link to the Google spreadsheet: [SheetDB test document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mrsgBk4IAdSs8Ask5H1z3bWYDlPTKplDIU_FzyktrGk/edit#gid=0)<br />
Our test API ID is `58f61be4dda40` and the endpoint URL is: [https://sheetdb.io/api/v1/58f61be4dda40](https://sheetdb.io/api/v1/58f61be4dda40)

<Note>
    We do not share this spreadsheet. You have permissions to read it and you can modify it using the API. If you want to play with the spreadsheet itself create your own API. The first 500 requests each month are free!
</Note>

## Making your first API request

Now you are ready to make your first call to the SheetDB API. Below you can see how to send a GET request to our test API.

<CodeGroup tag="GET" label="/api/v1/{API_ID}">

```bash {{ title: 'cURL' }}
curl https://sheetdb.io/api/v1/58f61be4dda40
```

```js
fetch('https://sheetdb.io/api/v1/58f61be4dda40')
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data));
```

```php
$client = new GuzzleHttp\Client();

$response = $client->get('https://sheetdb.io/api/v1/58f61be4dda40');

$response->getBody()->getContents();
```

</CodeGroup>

```json {{ title: 'JSON Response' }}
[
    {
        "id": "1",
        "name": "Tom",
        "age": "15",
        "comment": ""
    },
    {
        "id": "2",
        "name": "Alex",
        "age": "24",
        "comment": ""
    },
    {
        "id": "3",
        "name": "John",
        "age": "51",
        "comment": ""
    },
    {
        "id": "61",
        "name": "Steve",
        "age": "22",
        "comment": "special"
    },
    {
        "id": "422",
        "name": "James",
        "age": "19",
        "comment": ""
    }
]
```

<div className="not-prose">
  <Button
    href="/sheetdb-api/read"
    variant="text"
    arrow="right"
    children="Read the docs for the GET endpoint"
  />
</div>
