# Permissions

To protect your APIs set as few permissions as possible for your application to work. For example, if you plan to use the API to collect data from a form, leave only the `Create (POST)` permission. This way even if someone gets to know your endpoint, they won't be able to view or modify your data. {{ className: 'lead' }}

A request to an unauthorized endpoint will result in a `403 Forbidden` error. {{ className: 'lead' }}
